            Island Wide Nutrient Modeling and Quantification of Coastal Freshwater Discharge for Tutuila, AS

    <div class="accordion-content">
        Excessive dissolved inorganic nitrogen (DIN) concentrations promote algal growth, and reduce water quality, thereby impacting the structure and function of reef habitats. In response, regulators use water quality monitoring programs that focus on water quality thresholds  that usually exclude contributions from groundwater discharge or dilution effects, masking the true  human impacts on water quality in coral reefs. To address this need, we developed an island-wide dissolved inorganic nitrogen loading model for Tutuila, to improve understanding of nutrient loads and its impacts on nearshore reef environments. This model is the first of its kind and integrates streamflow data,  water budget modeling, and nutrient sampling data from 26 watersheds around Tutuila.  Results highlight the effects of groundwater discharge  and on-site wastewater disposal systems  as a major source of anthropogenic nitrogen to nearshore environments. These results are relevant to managers and regulators in pinpointing specific villages and sources of nitrogen pollution, thereby  helping to prioritize efforts to protect reefs and public health in American Samoa.

            Ground Penetrating Radar Field Test and Utility Locate Training Workshop, Tutuila, American Samoa

    <div class="accordion-content">
        In the islands of American Samoa, the primary water resources issues, aquifer salinization, excessive drawdowns, etc., are compounded by high losses in the form of non-revenue water caused by a deteriorating and leaky transmission system.  To address the need to locate pipes and leaks, a survey team consisting of utility staff and Shuler Hydrologic team members performed a test survey utilizing Ground Penetrating Radar (GPR) to locate and assess water pipe infrastructure on Tutuila, American Samoa. As a geophysical method, GPR uses electromagnetic (radio-spectrum) pulses that are directed into the ground from an antenna. Reflections of these pulses from subsurface features are produced where there is a contrast between the electrical properties of subsurface objects, such as utilities, and the surrounding soil.  Potential for use of GPR to detect leaks was also assessed, though the electrical properties of Tutuila's soils did not provide the clarity needed to resolve small leaks.             <p>Map of modeled DIN discharge to the coast</p>

            American Samoa Water Use Data: A Workplan  for Evaluation and  Improvement

    <div class="accordion-content">
        The American Samoa Water-Use Workplan was developed to assess the current state of water-use information in the territory of American Samoa. This includes territory-wide water-use data such as withdrawals from surface and groundwater sources, water delivery information organized by category of use, return flows back to the environment, and ancillary information including water source, salinity, or populations served. The workplan not only presents information about data availability in American Samoa, but also how data are stored, how data are communicated, and the feasibility of sharing data in their current formats.
