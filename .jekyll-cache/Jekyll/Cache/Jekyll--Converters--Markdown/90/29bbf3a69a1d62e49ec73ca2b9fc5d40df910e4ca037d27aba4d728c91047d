        Excessive dissolved inorganic nitrogen (DIN) concentrations promote algal growth, and reduce water quality, thereby impacting the structure and function of reef habitats. In response, regulators use water quality monitoring programs that focus on water quality thresholds  that usually exclude contributions from groundwater discharge or dilution effects, masking the true  human impacts on water quality in coral reefs. To address this need, we developed an island-wide dissolved inorganic nitrogen loading model for Tutuila, to improve understanding of nutrient loads and its impacts on nearshore reef environments. This model is the first of its kind and integrates streamflow data,  water budget modeling, and nutrient sampling data from 26 watersheds around Tutuila.  Results highlight the effects of groundwater discharge  and on-site wastewater disposal systems  as a major source of anthropogenic nitrogen to nearshore environments. These results are relevant to managers and regulators in pinpointing specific villages and sources of nitrogen pollution, thereby  helping to prioritize efforts to protect reefs and public health in American Samoa.
