American Samoa is currently a world leader in implementation of renewable energy resources on a widespread municipal scale.  Goals outlined by the American Samoa Renewable Energy Committee are to power Tutuila with 50% renewable energy by the year 2025, and 100% by the year 2040. However, the feasibility of PV systems is heavily reliant on numerous factors including  solar resource availability. This study provided an assessment of solar resource availability at sites throughout Tutuila with a focus on areas of high economic interest such as Aasu Village and Afono Pass.
