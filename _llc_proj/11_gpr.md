In the islands of American Samoa, the primary water resources issues, aquifer salinization, excessive drawdowns, etc., are compounded by high losses in the form of non-revenue water caused by a deteriorating and leaky transmission system.  To address the need to locate pipes and leaks, a survey team consisting of utility staff and Shuler Hydrologic team members performed a test survey utilizing Ground Penetrating Radar (GPR) to locate and assess water pipe infrastructure on Tutuila, American Samoa. As a geophysical method, GPR uses electromagnetic (radio-spectrum) pulses that are directed into the ground from an antenna. Reflections of these pulses from subsurface features are produced where there is a contrast between the electrical properties of subsurface objects, such as utilities, and the surrounding soil.  Potential for use of GPR to detect leaks was also assessed, though the electrical properties of Tutuila's soils did not provide the clarity needed to resolve small leaks.             <p>Map of modeled DIN discharge to the coast</p>
