The American Samoa Water-Use Workplan was developed to assess the current state of water-use information in the territory of American Samoa. This includes territory-wide water-use data such as withdrawals from surface and groundwater sources, water delivery information organized by category of use, return flows back to the environment, and ancillary information including water source, salinity, or populations served. The workplan not only presents information about data availability in American Samoa, but also how data are stored, how data are communicated, and the feasibility of sharing data in their current formats.
